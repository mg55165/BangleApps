This Tutorial allowed me to explore how to connect multiple devices and read temperature from Bangle.Js. Mainly focusing on
RECEIVNG and SENDING data from Bangle.js to my own git website.

GOAL: find how to develop and transfer data between watch and website in order to develop a survey and send it to the watch.
